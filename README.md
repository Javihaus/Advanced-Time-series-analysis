# Advanced-Time-series-analysis
Advance Time Series Analysis using Probabilistic Programming, Recurrent, LSTM, GRU Neural Networs and XGBboost Regression. We compare parametric vs. non-parametric methods as well stochastic vs. deterministic methods. The aim is to compare these methods.
I'm Using pymc3 for Probabilistic Programming (Gaussian Processes), Keras for LSTM models, Pytorch for RNN&GRU models and XGboost Regressor.
